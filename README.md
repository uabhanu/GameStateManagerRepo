# 🏛️ Modular Game Flow System (Singleton & State Pattern)

**Project Name:** GameStateManager | **Status:** Architectural Prototype | **Platform:** PC / WebGL

---

## 💡 Overview
This project is an architectural prototype demonstrating a robust, **decoupled system** for managing application states and system communication within a Unity project. It is designed to be highly extensible, scalable, and to eliminate tight coupling between core game systems.

This prototype serves as proof of proficiency in core C# object-oriented design and architectural patterns.

## 🧱 Core Architectural Concepts

This system is built upon three fundamental design patterns to ensure clean, professional code.

### 1. The Game Flow Manager (Singleton Pattern)
* **Purpose:** Ensures a single, persistent instance of the **`GameStateManager`** exists throughout the application lifecycle.
* **Benefit:** Provides a reliable, globally accessible entry point for state changes without the need for error-prone `FindObjectOfType<>()` calls.

### 2. State Management (State Pattern / FSM)
* **Purpose:** Defines the core game loop and cleanly separates the logic for each stage of the game.
* **Structure:** Utilises a parent class (`AbstractGameState`) and multiple concrete state classes (e.g., `MenuState`, `GameplayState`).
* **Benefit:** Allows for easy addition or modification of game states (e.g., adding a `CutsceneState` or `LoadingState`) without modifying the core `GameStateManager` class.

### 3. Decoupled Communication (Observer Pattern - Events)
* **Purpose:** Enables systems (like UI, Audio, Score) to react to game changes without direct references to the source that initiated the change.
* **Implementation (Future Branch):** Will use C# Events and Delegates (or Scriptable Objects) to create a **`GameEvents`** utility class.
* **Example:** When the `GameStateManager` transitions to `GameplayState`, it fires an `OnGameStarted` event. The `UIManager` simply **subscribes** to this event to show the HUD, keeping the code clean.

## ⚙️ Technical Stack
| Category | Detail | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Engine** | Unity 2023+ | The primary development environment. |
| **Language** | C# (DOT NET Standard 2.1) | Used for clean, object-oriented pattern implementation. |
| **Architecture** | Singleton, State Machine (FSM), Observer | Ensures scalable, maintainable, and loosely coupled codebase. |
| **Input** | Unity New Input System | Modern, event-based input handling. |

## 🗓️ Roadmap (Phase 1: Game Flow)
The goal is to complete the core flow and ensure every component is unit-testable.

| Status | Task | Feature Branch |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ✅ | **Project Setup:** Repository and basic Unity file structure. | `main` |
| 🚧 | **Singleton & FSM Implementation:** Complete core state machine and manager. | `feature/implement-fsm-singleton` |
| ⬜ | **Observer Pattern:** Implement the `GameEvents` system using C# Events. | `feature/add-event-system` |
